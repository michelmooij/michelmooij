      <description>Is the free market is still able to steer the production and distribution of goods and services to sustain a peaceful society or is it time to replace it by a new economic system which uses AI to distribute the wealth with algorithms and big data?
Animal Robots, by Henk Mooij 1930-2015
Artificial Intelligence (AI), I would rather call it high intelligence because it is not so much the artificiality that matters, but the fact that it will soon be superior to human intelligence.</description>

      <description>I graduated at the Academy of Architecture, Hanze University Groningen in 1980. After a successful period of architects practice I changed my carreer to Information Technology. After many a project in IT with Pandata(CAP Gemini) I decided to return to my architects roots and to combine both expertises. I joined Twijnstra Gudde, a Dutch consultancy firm, where I was involved in the introduction of Facility Management in the Netherlands in 1989.</description>

      <description>As a management consultant and former architect, I help organizations to formulate a spatial planning strategy. Based on my experience in architecture, urbanism, sustainability, information technolologie and the way of working I propose new insights in the behavior of organizations in their spatial context. For example on the impact of technological unemployment and its implications for urban design. I also share my knowledge by speaking at conferences and publishing in professional journals.</description>

      <description>I sincerely believed that my vision of &amp;lsquo;new ways of working&amp;rsquo; was all about the impact of IT, enabling new office concepts to increase productivity with less office space. But now I see that it evolves into the implementation of artificial intelligence, providing new ways to work with fewer people. To paraphrase the title of the book by my colleague Erik Veldhoen, &amp;lsquo;The demise of the office’, I fear for &amp;lsquo;The demise of the employee&amp;rsquo;.</description>
