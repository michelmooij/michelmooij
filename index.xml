      <description>Does technology increase our ability to perform, or are we going to fully automate our lives?
Click and ready, so easy is an automated camera
Someone who until recently could not photograph at all can nowadays do very successful with his smartphone. People show the most beautiful photos on Instagram. But you might ask yourself who is really taking pictures, the photographer or the smartphone with the apps? The technology takes so much out of your hands that there is hardly any question of photographing by yourself.</description>

      <description>Context for New Ways of Working
Usually, it is not customer needs, that set the specifications for the development of technology. It is the marketing of an emerging technology that arouses the client’s desire. Developpers of new gadgets like smartphones and tablets responded to potential needs, which manifested when the possibilities of the new technology emerged. We have allowed the smartphones into our lives, changing our communication and work behavior to adapt to the new opportunities.</description>

      <description>Is the free market is still able to steer the production and distribution of goods and services to sustain a peaceful society or is it time to replace it by a new economic system which uses AI to distribute the wealth with algorithms and big data?
Animal Robots, by Henk Mooij 1930-2015
Artificial Intelligence (AI), I would rather call it high intelligence because it is not so much the artificiality that matters, but the fact that it will soon be superior to human intelligence.</description>

      <description>I graduated at the Academy of Architecture, Hanze University Groningen in 1980. After a successful period of architects practice I changed my carreer to Information Technology. After many a project in IT with Pandata(CAP Gemini) I decided to return to my architects roots and to combine both expertises. I joined Twijnstra Gudde, a Dutch consultancy firm, where I was involved in the introduction of Facility Management in the Netherlands in 1989.</description>

      <description>As a management consultant and former architect, I help organizations to formulate a spatial planning strategy. Based on my experience in architecture, urbanism, sustainability, information technolologie and the way of working I propose new insights in the behavior of organizations in their spatial context. For example on the impact of technological unemployment and its implications for urban design. I also share my knowledge by speaking at conferences and publishing in professional journals.</description>

      <description>I sincerely believed that my vision of &amp;lsquo;new ways of working&amp;rsquo; was all about the impact of IT, enabling new office concepts to increase productivity with less office space. But now I see that it evolves into the implementation of artificial intelligence, providing new ways to work with fewer people. To paraphrase the title of the book by my colleague Erik Veldhoen, &amp;lsquo;The demise of the office’, I fear for &amp;lsquo;The demise of the employee&amp;rsquo;.</description>
