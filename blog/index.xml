      <description>Is the free market is still able to steer the production and distribution of goods and services to sustain a peaceful society or is it time to replace it by a new economic system which uses AI to distribute the wealth with algorithms and big data?

To paraphrase the title of the book by my colleague Erik Veldhoen, &amp;lsquo;The demise of the office’, I fear for &amp;lsquo;The demise of the employee&amp;rsquo;.</description>
